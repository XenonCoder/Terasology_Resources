Voxel 3D models, for the implementation of characters and NPCs in Terasology.
<br/>

The idea is to make Terasology similar to MC, but with a different aspect, new and innovative features, with strong RPG elements and exploration.
<br/>

### Objectives achieved:
<br/>

- [x] Creation of whole NPC models, and divided by categories (heads, bodies, hands, feet).
- [X] Creation textures for the face of the characters (facial expressions).
- [X] Creation of objects associated with the various NPC categories (Blacksmith anvil, armor for guards, weapons, various objects)
<br/>

### Objectives in process:
<br/>

- [ ] Create documentation of the modeling process, and conversion of models and materials.
- [ ] Model optimization (number of polygons, vertices and more).
- [ ] Creation of models for animals.
- [ ] Creation of the "TeraMobs" module, to test the models in game.
